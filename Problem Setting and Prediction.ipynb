    "Stock Time Series Data: Air pollution data can be treated as stock time series data when measuring the concentration or level of pollutants at a specific point in time. For example, measurements of particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), or ozone (O3) levels taken at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly) represent stock data. Each data point represents the stock or quantity of the pollutant at that particular time.\n",

This typically involves measurements of pollutant emissions or pollutant concentrations over a specific time period. For example, hourly emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) from a specific source or the daily average concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in a particular region represent flow data. Each data point represents the flow or rate of the pollutant during that time interval."

    "Pollutants released during open pit mining are :\n",
    "\n",
    "Dust and Particulate Matter (PM): Open pit mining involves excavation and movement of large amounts of soil, rock, and ore. This activity generates dust and particulate matter, which can include both coarse particles (PM10) and fine particles (PM2.5). These particles can cause air pollution and have potential health impacts when inhaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sulfur Dioxide (SO2): Mining operations involving sulfide ores, such as copper, lead, and zinc, can release sulfur dioxide into the air. Sulfur dioxide is produced when sulfide minerals are exposed to air and react with oxygen. It is a major contributor to acid rain and can have adverse effects on human health and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): Equipment and machinery used in open pit mining, such as diesel-powered vehicles and machinery, can emit nitrogen oxides. Nitrogen oxides are formed during the combustion process and contribute to air pollution. They are known to contribute to the formation of smog, respiratory issues, and environmental degradation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Various mining activities, including blasting, drilling, and processing of ores, can release volatile organic compounds. These compounds can include hydrocarbons and other chemicals that evaporate easily into the air. VOC emissions contribute to air pollution and can have adverse effects on human health and the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy Metals: Mining operations can release heavy metals such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and others. These metals are naturally present in many ores and can be released into the environment through various mining processes, such as ore crushing, grinding, and ore processing. Heavy metals can persist in the environment, accumulate in the food chain, and pose significant health and ecological risks."

    "The time it takes for pollutants to release after blasting in open pit mines can vary depending on several factors, including the type of blasting method used, the characteristics of the rock or ore being blasted, and the atmospheric conditions at the site. Here are some considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantaneous Release: Some pollutants, such as dust and particulate matter (PM), are typically released instantaneously or within seconds after the blast. The explosion and subsequent fragmentation of rock or ore can generate a cloud of dust and particulates that disperses rapidly into the surrounding air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaseous Emissions: Gaseous pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can also be released during blasting. The time it takes for these gases to be emitted and disperse depends on various factors, including the chemical composition of the rock or ore, the extent of mineral oxidation or reaction, and the ventilation conditions in the mining area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersion and Transport: Once the pollutants are released, their dispersion and transport in the air depend on atmospheric conditions, such as wind speed and direction. Pollutants can disperse and travel different distances from the source, influenced by factors like air stability, topography, and nearby structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration of Impact: The duration of pollutant impact after blasting can vary. Dust and particulate matter can settle relatively quickly, depending on particle size and environmental conditions. Gaseous emissions may persist for a longer duration, particularly if there are ongoing processes or activities at the mining site that continue to release pollutants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic : Due to traffic and movement of vehicles in the region may increase or decrease the density of the air pollutants as dust is being carried away and the transportation of coal from open pit mines in India can occur throughout the day, depending on various factors such as operational requirements, logistical considerations, and local regulations. Coal mining operations in India typically involve round-the-clock activities to meet the demand for coal. Therefore, coal transportation can take place at any time, including day and night shifts. This can also result in the wrongly estimated time for blasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual Blasting Time : It may also be the case that the actual blasting time was not the preferred blasting time and the data given to us itself is faulty for some days. This could happed due to various reasons such as failure of blasting equipment like dynamite or non-avaivalibality of those equipment or delay by the workes or the whether condition which which were not suitable for blasting."

    "To conduct descriptive analysis for air pollution data classified as stock time series data, you can perform several techniques to gain insights into the data distribution, patterns, and trends. Here are some approaches to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting Time Series: Create line plots or area plots to visualize the pollution levels over time. This will help you observe the general trends, seasonality, and any irregular patterns in the data  as done above.\n",
    "Heatmaps: Create heatmaps to display pollution levels across different time intervals or geographical locations. This can help identify any spatial or temporal patterns.\n",
    "We could not plot heatmaps as we were not povided any information about the particular location of blasting or mining but just the density of pollutants in the nearby region\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure Central Tendency: Calculate measures like mean, median, and mode to understand the typical pollution levels.\n",
    "Assess Dispersion: Compute measures such as standard deviation, variance, or range to evaluate the variability or spread of pollution levels. This is also done above in TSA with nan = 0 and nan = mean \n",
    "Identify Outliers: Detect any extreme values or outliers in the data that may require further investigation. Instead of further investigation we discarded the extreme data which we were getting due to interpolation as it was of no use to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seasonal Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decompose the time series data into its constituent components: trend, seasonality, and residual. This can be done using techniques like seasonal decomposition of time series (e.g., STL decomposition) or moving averages. Analyzing these components will provide insights into long-term trends and seasonal variations in pollution levels. We checked for seasonality in the Interpolation and Seasonality part and estimated the missing data points for some pollutants which show seasonality.\n",
    "We also did the residue and density plot for various pollutants and estimated that most of the residue was white noise as it has mean 0 and constant variance. Whereas the density mostly followed normal and cauchy distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Autocorrelation: Measure autocorrelation to assess the relationship between past and current pollution levels. This can be done using autocorrelation plots (ACF) or partial autocorrelation plots (PACF). Significant autocorrelation at specific lags may indicate temporal dependencies or patterns in the data. This was also done above\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stationarity Test: Perform tests for stationarity, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, to determine if the pollution data exhibits a constant mean and variance over time. We conducted ADF test for all the pollutants separately and together also to test and train our ARIM model above."
